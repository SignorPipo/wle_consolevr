## Description
Have you ever wondered why you need to remove your headset to read the browser console? Well me too, that's why I've created the marvelous Console VR! And you don't even have to call something special, just spam those console.log, and the Console VR will do the work for you! <3

### Features
This is what you can do with the Console VR:
  - Read messages from the VR session, no need to remove your headset
  - Filter by message type, like log, error, warn, and info
  - Clear the console
  - Scroll up an down
  - Show and hide the Console VR by pressing L3 + R3
  - Get a pulse notification on your gamepad when a new message is received
  - Choose your handedness


### Customization
You can customize the Console VR with a lot of parameters! Just some of them are shown on the component, while the majority of them can be edited inside the `console_vr_setup.js` script.
You can for example edit:
  - Colors
  - Font size
  - Max number of lines shown
  - Scroll speed
  - ...

### Weaknesses
There are sadly some things the marvellous Console VR can't achieve yet, this include:
  - Object will be displayed as \[Object object]
  - Placeholder like %d and other similar kind of way to build strings are not supported
  - Some messages are not intercepted, like the error from glMatrix.mat4.invert(null, null)
